    "- The final line of output should look something like:\n",

    "## Go-Back-N File Transfer Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review the code for the `GBN_Client.py` and `GBN_Server.py` programs (we will do this together in class). Note that you can view them on Github, or download and view in your preferred text editor. Or you can view them on a remote Fabric node using the command `cat <filename>` (e.g. `cat GBN _Server.py`) to print the file contents to your terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the GBN_Server.py program on your Server Node using the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 GBN_Server.py -f copy_100KB.txt\n",

    "\n",
    "- To verify that the file was copied correctly, you should run the process in reverse to copy it back to your Client Node and compare it to the original file.\n",
    "    - Run the GBN_Server.py program on your **Client Node** using the command: `python3 GBN_Server.py -f returned_100KB.txt`\n",

    "    If the `diff` command gives no output, then the files are identical (and everything worked correctly). If the files differ, the diff command will print out the differences between the files (if this happens, something went wrong – talk to the instructor to check your setup). Note that you can also visually inspect a file using the command `cat <filename>` (e.g. `cat copy_100KB.txt`) to print it to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Window Size and Throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the GBN_Client.py program sends packets of 1000 bytes each and uses a window of only 1 packet (so it is actually equivalent to the “Stop-and-Wait” protocol we discussed).\n",

    "- Based on the packet size and window size information above, calculate the expected throughput (in Mbps).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, that since the sender is limited to one window of unacknowledged packets at any time, and receiving an ACK takes one RTT, our expected throughput is approximately: **(window\\_size x packet\\_size)/RTT**\n",

    "**Enter your answer in Lab2.docx**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can change the window size used by the GBN_Client by using the -w command line option. Re-run the GBN Client and Server using the window you calculated in part (2) above to transfer the 1 Megabyte test file.\n",

    "## Loss Emulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can’t predict whether we will actually encounter packet loss during our experiments, here we will artificially inject loss to examine its effects on our programs\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create artificial loss, run the following command on each of your Fabric Nodes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo tc qdisc add dev enp7s0 root netem loss 1%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t worry about the details of this command – its effect is to randomly drop 1% of the packets leaving each node.\n",

    "- Why do you think this timeout is needed? **Answer in Lab2.docx**\n",
    "- To illustrate why the timeout is used, try the following to create a scenario with high loss (25%) and a short timeout (100ms):\n",

    "If you run this scenario several times (re-run the server and client, without changing the loss settings), you will likely encounter the scenario where the sender (client) does not terminate but instead keeps trying to retransmit the last packet (in this case, you should `CTRL+C` the client to kill the program). What is the specific event that leads to this outcome? **Answer in Lab2.docx**\n",

    "\n",
    "- A simple idea (5 points):\n",
    "    - Instead of requiring the server specify a file name to save the file as, have the client send a special first packet that gives the file name (this will likely require adding a new packet type in util.py)\n",
    "- More involved (15 points):\n",
    "    - Change the Go-Back-N implementation to buffer out-of-order packets instead of discarding them, so the sender does not need to re-send the entire window on loss (similar to TCP)\n"
