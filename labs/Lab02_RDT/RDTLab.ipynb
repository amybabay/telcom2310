    "\n",
    "1. SSH into each node:\n",
    "    - Go to the [Experiments](https://portal.fabric-testbed.net/experiments) page in the Fabric portal.\n",
    "    - Click on the \"telcom2310-fall23-babay\" project\n",
    "    - Click on \"Slices\" (on the lefthand side of the page)\n",
    "    - Click on the \"Lab02_RDT\" slice. This should bring up a visual representation of your topology.\n",
    "    - For each node:\n",

    "        - Open a terminal window (either on your local machine or in the JupyterHub) and enter the copied command, replacing `<path to SSH config file>` and `<path to private sliver key>` with the correct paths. For example, on JupyterHub, this would look like `ssh -F ~/work/fabric_config/ssh_config -i ~/work/fabric_config/fabric_sliver_key ubuntu@205.172.170.122`\n",

    "\n",
    "- On your Client Node, run the command: `ping <ServerNode_IP_Address>`, where `<ServerNode_IP_Address>` is replaced with the IP address of your Server Node found in “Getting Started” above\n",
    "- Let it run for at least 10 pings and then use CTRL-C to kill the program\n",
    "- The final line of output should look something like:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Go-Back-N File Transfer Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review the code for the `GBN_Client.py` and `GBN_Server.py` programs (we will do this together in class). Note that you can use your preferred text editor on your own computer to view copies downloaded from Canvas. Or you can view them on a remote Fabric node using the command `cat <filename>` (e.g. `cat GBN _Server.py`) to print the file contents to your terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the GBN_Server.py program on your Server Node using the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 GBN_Server.py -f copy_100KB.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "- To verify that the file was copied correctly, you should run the process in reverse to copy it back to your Client Node and compare it to the original file.\n",
    "    - Run the GBN_Server.py program on your **Client Node** using the command: `python3 GBN_Server.py -f returned_100KB.txt`\n",

    "    If the `diff` command gives no output, then the files are identical (and everything worked correctly). If the files differ, the diff command will print out the differences between the files (if this happens, something went wrong – talk to the instructor to check your setup). Note that you can also visually inspect a file using the command `cat <filename>` (e.g. `cat copy_100KB.txt`) to print it to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Window Size and Throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the GBN_Client.py program sends packets of 1000 bytes each and uses a window of only 1 packet (so it is actually equivalent to the “Stop-and-Wait” protocol we discussed).\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall, that since the sender is limited to one window of unacknowledged packets at any time, and receiving an ACK takes one RTT, our expected throughput is approximately: **(window\\_size x packet\\_size)/RTT**\n",

    "**Enter your answer in Lab2.docx**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can change the window size used by the GBN_Client by using the -w command line option. Re-run the GBN Client and Server using the window you calculated in part (2) above to transfer the 1 Megabyte test file.\n",
    "On Server Node:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 GBN_Server.py -f copy_1MB.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "**Copy and paste your output in Lab2.docx Do the results match your expectation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss Emulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can’t predict whether we will actually encounter packet loss during our experiments, here we will artificially inject loss to examine its effects on our programs\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create artificial loss, run the following command on each of your Fabric Nodes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem loss 1%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t worry about the details of this command – its effect is to randomly drop 1% of the packets leaving each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the GBN_Server.py program on your Server Node using the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 GBN_Server.py -f copy_1MB.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the GBN_Client.py program on your GENI Node 2 using the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 GBN_Client.py -a <ServerNode_IP_Address> -f test_file_1MB.txt -w <Calculated_Window_Size>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `<ServerNode_IP_Address>` is replaced with the IP address of your Server Node found in the “Getting Started” section above. **Copy and paste the output from your server and client into Lab2.docx**\n",
    "\n",
    "How many timeouts do you observe? How many would you expect (based on loss rate and total number of 1000-byte packets needed to transfer a 1 MB file)? **Answer in Lab2.docx**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the GBN_Server waits for 2 seconds before exiting. Review the GBN_Server.py code to see where this happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why do you think this timeout is needed? **Answer in Lab2.docx**\n",
    "- To illustrate why the timeout is used, try the following to create a scenario with high loss (25%) and a short timeout (100ms):\n",
    "\n",
    "On each node:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo tc qdisc add dev ens7 root netem loss 25%\n",
    "```\n",

    "python3 GBN_Client.py -f test_file_10KB.txt -w <Window_for_1Mbps> -a <Node1_IP_Address>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run this scenario several times (re-run the server and client, without changing the loss settings), you will likely encounter the scenario where the sender (client) does not terminate but instead keeps trying to retransmit the last packet (in this case, you should `CTRL+C` the client to kill the program). What is the specific event that leads to this outcome? **Answer in Lab2.docx**\n",
    "\n",

    "## Bonus: Improve the programs\n",
    "\n",
    "You can earn bonus points for implementing a new feature to improve the program. The amount of the bonus will depend on how interesting the improvement is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple idea (5 points):\n",
    "    - Instead of requiring the server specify a file name to save the file as, have the client send a special first packet that gives the file name (this will likely require adding a new packet type in util.py)\n",
    "- More involved (15 points):\n",
    "    - Change the Go-Back-N implementation to buffer out-of-order packets instead of discarding them, so the sender does not need to re-send the entire window on loss (similar to TCP)\n",
    "- Performance optimizations (TBD points):\n",
    "    - This program is a very simple implementation of Go-Back-N, since the emphasis is on understanding the protocol, as opposed to performance. Right now it only works well up to about 7 Mbps. See what you can do to improve it!"
