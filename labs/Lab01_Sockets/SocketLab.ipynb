    "### Bonus: Persistent TCP Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example TCP_Ping programs, notice that a new TCP connection is created for each ping that is performed. This is similar to how HTTP works when using **non-persistent connections**: a new connection is initiated for **each request+response pair**. In class, we discussed how **persistent connections** could be used instead so that **multiple requests/responses can be sent over the same TCP connection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the effect of this, you should create a TCP_Ping_Server_Persistent.py and TCP_Ping_Client_Persistent.py that modify the example TCP_Ping_Server.py and TCP_Ping_Client.py programs such that all ping+response messages for a single run of the client program are sent over the **same** TCP connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 1: Start with the client side. This part should be fairly straightforward and involve moving the socket, connect, and close calls outside of the while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint 2: After your client sends all of its ping messages (and gets responses for them) it will close the TCP connection. After this point, if the server calls “recv” on the connection socket again, it will return an empty message. In Python, you can check for this condition with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = connection_socket.recv(RECV_BUFFER_SIZE)\n",
    "if not message: # Check for empty message\n",
    "    # Do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, each time the server calls recv, it should check whether the connection was closed. If it was, then the server should also close the connection socket. At this point you can choose to quit the server (easier and perfectly fine for our purposes, but not quite as nice), or go back to listening for new connections to accept.\n",
